                    The sole reason blockchains were invented was to make an immutable, censorship-proof database. If you use a blockchain, no centrala authority has the power to unilaterally modify records.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Editable blockchains are like infrared coloured fireworks.                     They're straightforward to build, but there's no point creating such a thing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Just use a normal database. That way other parties can't make it illegal to store or transmit your own database.

                    Bitcoin is the world's most famous blockchain, and it can only process about 3 transactions per second. Other versions of that algorithm can deal with a little bit more, typically at the expense of security. Claims of substantially faster blockchains are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware">vapourware</a>.

                    It's designed to allow multiple people to modify code in the repository at the same time. It has an auditable history of all changes made to the data. Most developers already know how to use it, and there's a large ecosystem of <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">tools</a> and <a href="http://gitlab.com/">hosting</a> <a href="github.com">systems</a> for it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    If you want, you can use cryptographic signatures to verify writes to the repo.

                 <p>
                    Git repos are like blockchains. The main differences are that they don't emit more pollution than whole countries, and they have useable write throughput rates.

                 <p>
                    Also, git is a decade old well proven technology which most developers already have the skills to use. Whereas blockchain projects are largely vapourware, with eye-watering consultancy price tags.

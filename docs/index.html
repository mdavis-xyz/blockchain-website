                    Blockchains are like a normal database, but deliberately slow to allow many parties to write without centralised coordination or authority.

                    You're only allowing trusted parties to write to the database. So you'll need an authority who approves or denies parties wanting to write to the database.

                 <p>
                    Blockchains are no better at verifying things in the real world than any other database.

                 <p>
                    The hard part of verification is converting real attributes of physical things into bytes. Blockchains don't help with that. They just take the bytes they're given and put them on hard drives, slowly.

                    If you need to add a verification system to your verification blockchain, why do you need the blockchain?

                 <p>
                    Blockchains are no better at verifying things in the real world than any other database.

                 <p>
                    The hard part of verification is converting real attributes of physical things into bytes. Blockchains don't help with that. They just take the bytes they're given and put them on hard drives, slowly.

                 <p>
                    The only way you can modify a blockchain is to convince everyone using it to instead use a new amended copy, and ignore the old copy. This is called a <a target="_blank" href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/the-dao/">soft fork</a>. This requires a lot of effort, and involves convincing a large community (who are not all trustworthy) to throw away the cherished immutability property of blockchains.

                    Bitcoin is the world's most famous blockchain, and it can only process about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transactions-per-second?timespan=30days">3 transactions per second</a>. Other versions of that algorithm can deal with a little bit more, typically at the expense of security.

                    Satoshi (the inventor of blockchains) found a loophole. It's possible, by using as  much electricity as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6">a whole country</a>, spent powering many computers playing <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZH-cXBhkl-E?t=21s">Number Wang</a>.

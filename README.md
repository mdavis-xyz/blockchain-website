# Do You Need A Blockchain

This is for my (not yet published) web page.

I often hear people come across almost any problem and proclaim 'maybe blockchains can help?' (e.g. voting, supply chain verification, electricity grid operation)

In almost all cases the answer is no, they can't help.
It's hard to get people to see this, so I made this site to spell that out to people.

## Javascript

I initially tried using revealjs for this. However I found that it can't cope with scrolling of long content.
So I taught myself css and wrote a stripped down version from scratch.
The hard part is vertically centering short pages, whilst keeping long pages scrollable.

The website itself doesn't contain images. However I added one in the metadata for facebook share previews. That's from [here](https://unsplash.com/photos/1GepXKtYUK8).
